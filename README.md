# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge


# Module 19 Report

## Prepare the Data

* Loading data
* Plot overview of percentage changes for all coins

## Clustering 

*Scaling all the data
*Runing elbow clurve analysis for best k value
*Running clustering analysis with best k value

## Dimensionality reduction

*Reduce dimensions to the 3 highest impact dimensions
*Run elbow analysis and clustering algorithm on reduced dimensions
*Apply new clustering on the original data

## Summary

*Inertia is better for the PCA data, which indicates better clustering, and the elbow k values are similar
*We can also see visually the improvement over the clustering for the PCA method
